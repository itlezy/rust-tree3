# TREE(3) Sequence Explorer: Rust CLI for Kruskal Trees, Googology, and SVG Visualization

**TREE(3) Sequence Explorer** is a Rust command-line tool for experimenting with Harvey Friedman's TREE function, Kruskal's Tree Theorem, rooted labeled trees, homeomorphic tree embeddings, and googology-scale finite combinatorics.

It **computes and visualizes candidate initial sequences** for TREE(k), then renders each valid rooted tree as an SVG file. This is not a static drawing tool: it runs the combinatorial search, checks homeomorphic tree embeddings, supports greedy and exhaustive strategies, and exports reproducible SVG/JSON output.

Common searches this project is meant to answer:

- How can I compute or visualize initial TREE(3) sequences?
- What does a TREE(3) rooted labeled tree sequence look like?
- How do homeomorphic embeddings work for Kruskal trees?
- Is there a Rust implementation for exploring TREE(k), TREE(2), or TREE(3)?

## 1. What is TREE(3)?

TREE(3) is the third value of Harvey Friedman's **TREE function**, defined in the context of Kruskal's Tree Theorem from combinatorics and mathematical logic.

### The TREE Game

Given a positive integer k, play the following game:

> Build a sequence of finite rooted trees T₁, T₂, T₃, ... where:
> - Each tree Tᵢ has node labels drawn from the set {1, 2, ..., k}
> - The i-th tree has **at most i nodes**
> - **No earlier tree may homeomorphically embed into any later tree** — i.e., for all i < j, Tᵢ does NOT embed into Tⱼ

**TREE(k)** is the length of the longest such sequence.

### Known Values

| k | TREE(k) |
|---|---------|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | **incomprehensibly large** |

TREE(1) = 1 because with only label `1`, any two trees of the same structure will embed into each other, so after one single-node tree the game ends.

TREE(2) = 3: the longest valid sequence with labels {1, 2} is exactly 3 trees long — this is provable and verifiable by exhaustive search.

TREE(3) is **finite** (guaranteed by Kruskal's Tree Theorem), but its value is so astronomically large that it vastly exceeds Graham's number, TREE(2) raised to TREE(2), or virtually any other large number that has ever appeared in mathematics. It cannot be expressed using ordinary exponential towers. It requires the **fast-growing hierarchy** at levels corresponding to the **small Veblen ordinal** just to write down.

### Why is it so large?

With 3 labels, the combinatorial space of labeled trees grows much faster than with 2 labels. The no-embedding constraint forces the sequence to use increasingly complex tree structures before it must terminate — and the point at which it can no longer continue is staggeringly far away.

## 2. Original Specification

The design of this tool is based on two specifications:

- [`docs/TREE3_spec.md`](docs/TREE3_spec.md) — Python-oriented initial specification (data model, embedding algorithm, visualization approach)
- [`docs/TREE3_spec2.md`](docs/TREE3_spec2.md) — Rust engineering specification (architecture, libraries, CLI, modules)

Key prescriptions from the Rust spec:

### Language: Rust

Chosen for:
- **Performance** — tree sequence exploration grows extremely fast; a slow language hits walls immediately
- **Memory safety** — prevents crashes during large-scale graph exploration
- **Concurrency** — Rust's ownership model makes parallel search safe and ergonomic
- **Ecosystem** — excellent CLI (`clap`), serialization (`serde`), and graph libraries

### Libraries specified

| Purpose | Library |
|---------|---------|
| CLI parsing | `clap` (derive API) |
| Serialization | `serde` + `serde_json` |
| SVG generation | manual string formatting (spec allowed this) |
| Graph handling | not used — custom arena-based tree |

The spec also mentioned `petgraph` for graph handling and `indicatif` for progress bars — both were ultimately not used, as the custom arena tree proved simpler and sufficient, and `eprintln!` output was adequate for progress.

### Core modules specified

```
cli.rs       — CLI interface
tree.rs      — data structures
embedding.rs — homeomorphic embedding check
generator.rs — sequence generation
canonical.rs — canonical form for deduplication
svg.rs       — SVG rendering
layout.rs    — tree layout algorithm
cache.rs     — embedding result cache
```

The implementation merges `svg.rs` + `layout.rs` into `svg_render.rs` and inlines the cache into `generator.rs`.

---

## 3. Mathematical Model

### Trees

A **rooted labeled tree** is a finite tree where:
- One node is designated the **root**
- Every node carries a **label** from {1, ..., k}
- Children are **unordered** (the set of children, not a sequence)

### Homeomorphic Embedding

Tree A **homeomorphically embeds** into tree B if there exists an **injective** map f: V(A) → V(B) such that:

1. **Label preservation**: `label(v) = label(f(v))` for all v in A (exact match — not ≤)
2. **Ancestor preservation**: if u is a proper ancestor of v in A, then f(u) is a proper ancestor of f(v) in B

This is also called a **topological minor** embedding for rooted trees.

> **Note on label matching**: The spec originally described the constraint as `label(a) ≤ label(b)`. The implementation uses **exact label equality**, which is the correct definition for Friedman's TREE function. The ≤ variant would define a different (and less restrictive) embedding relation.

### Recursive Characterization

For unordered rooted trees, homeomorphic embedding has a clean recursive characterization:

> A subtree rooted at `a` embeds into a subtree rooted at `b` (with `a` mapping to `b`) if and only if:
> 1. `label(a) = label(b)`
> 2. Each child of `a` can be injectively matched to a **distinct child** of `b`, such that each a-child's subtree embeds *somewhere* in the matched b-child's subtree

This is implemented as mutual recursion between `embeds_into_subtree` and `can_embed_in_subtree`.

### Canonical Form

To avoid processing duplicate trees, every tree is reduced to a **canonical string**:

```
label(child1,child2,...)
```

where children are sorted **lexicographically** by their own canonical string. A leaf is represented as just its label string. Examples:

```
1              — single node, label 1
2(2)           — root label 2, one child label 2
2(3(3))        — root 2, child 3, grandchild 3
2(3,3,3)       — root 2, three children all labeled 3
3(2(3),2(3))   — root 3, two children each being "2 with child 3"
```

---

## 4. Implementation Decisions

### 4.1 Arena-Based Tree Storage

Trees are stored as `Vec<Node>` where each node contains:
- `label: u32`
- `children: Vec<usize>` (indices into the vec)
- `parent: Option<usize>`

This avoids heap allocations per node, makes cloning cheap, and keeps indices stable. The trade-off is that node removal is not supported — but for this use case (build once, read many times) it is ideal.

### 4.2 No `petgraph` Dependency

The spec recommended `petgraph` for graph handling. It was dropped because:
- Trees are a restricted case of graphs; the full graph API adds unnecessary complexity
- Arena indexing (`Vec<Node>`) is simpler, faster for cache-coherent access, and directly serializable with `serde`
- No graph algorithms beyond DFS/BFS are needed

### 4.3 Embedding Algorithm: Backtracking over Children

The core challenge is matching children of A's node to children of B's node injectively. This is solved with recursive backtracking and a `used: Vec<bool>` bitmask:

```
match_children(a_children, b_children, used):
    if a_children is empty: return true
    ac = a_children[0]
    for each (i, bc) in b_children:
        if not used[i] and can_embed_in_subtree(ac, bc):
            mark used[i]
            if match_children(a_children[1..], b_children, used):
                return true
            unmark used[i]
    return false
```

The key split between `embeds_into_subtree` (a maps exactly to b) and `can_embed_in_subtree` (a maps anywhere within b's subtree) is what makes this correct: children of a node in A must go to **different branches** of b's children, but within each branch they can embed at any depth.

### 4.4 No Global Embedding Cache

The spec called for a `HashMap<(TreeId, TreeId), bool>` embedding cache. This was intentionally omitted because:
- Trees do not have stable IDs across a run (they are regenerated from canonical form)
- The canonical string pairs *would* work as cache keys, but the overhead of hashing large strings for short sequences is significant
- For the sequence lengths achievable within the node budget (≤ 50 trees with max 10 nodes), the backtracking terminates fast enough without caching

A future optimization would add memoization keyed on `(canonical_a, canonical_b)`.

### 4.5 Tree Generation: Recursive Partitioning with Memoization

All distinct trees of size `n` with labels `1..=k` are generated by:

1. For each root label `l` in `1..=k`:
2. Enumerate all **multisets** of subtrees whose sizes sum to `n-1`
3. For each such multiset, build `Tree::from_root_and_children(l, children)`
4. Deduplicate via canonical form

The partition enumeration (`gen_combos_cached`) generates subtrees in non-decreasing canonical order, which automatically avoids duplicate multisets without needing a separate dedup step. Results are memoized in a `HashMap<(size, k), Vec<(String, Tree)>>`.

Tree counts grow rapidly:

| Size | Count (k=3) |
|------|------------|
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 9 |
| 3 | 45 |
| 4 | 246 |
| 5 | 1,485 |
| 6 | 9,432 |
| 7 | 62,625 |
| 8 | 428,319 |
| **Total ≤ 8** | **502,164** |

### 4.6 TREE(k) Node Budget Rule

The i-th tree in the sequence is allowed **at most i nodes** (matching Friedman's original definition). This is enforced in `generate_sequence` as:

```rust
let allowed_size = position.min(max_nodes);
```

The `--max-nodes` flag provides a hard cap on top of this, preventing the tool from needing to enumerate millions of trees for large positions.

### 4.7 Selection Strategies

Four strategies control how candidates are chosen at each position:

- **`largest`** (default): Greedy — pick the largest valid tree first. Tends to produce longer sequences because larger trees are harder to embed into later ones.
- **`smallest`**: Greedy — pick the smallest valid tree first. Produces shorter but structurally simpler sequences; useful for exploring the minimum-complexity end of the search space.
- **`random`**: Greedy — pick a uniformly random valid tree at each position. Each run explores a different region of the search space. Use `--seed N` for reproducible results.
- **`optimal`**: Exhaustive DFS backtracking — finds the **longest possible** valid sequence within the given node budget. Exponential time; practical only for `--max-nodes ≤ 6` with k=3. See section 4.10.

The three greedy strategies are not guaranteed to produce the longest possible sequence.

### 4.8 Memory Allocation Strategy

Memory use splits into two distinct phases:

**Pre-warm phase (allocation-heavy):** `all_trees_of_size_cached` recursively builds every distinct tree via `graft`, which clones and re-indexes child subtrees. Each `Tree` is a `Vec<Node>` on the heap; the `TreeCache` (`HashMap<(size, k), Vec<(String, Tree)>>`) holds the canonical copies and callers own separate clones. For `--max-nodes 8` this produces ~502k trees; for 10, ~24.5M.

**Hot loop (nearly allocation-free):** Once `CandidatePool` is built, each position only atomically reads/writes two flat arrays:

| Array | Type | Size (8-node default) | Pinned in RAM |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fingerprints` | `Vec<TreeFingerprint>` (17-byte `Copy`) | ~8 MB | Yes |
| `rejected` | `Vec<AtomicBool>` | ~502 KB | Yes |

Both are locked into physical RAM at construction (`VirtualLock` on Windows, `mlock` on Unix) so the OS cannot page them to swap. On Windows the process working set is expanded first via `SetProcessWorkingSetSizeEx`. Failure is non-fatal — execution continues with OS-managed memory.

`TreeFingerprint` itself is entirely **stack-allocated** (17 bytes, `Copy`) — no heap involvement in the O(1) pre-rejection gate.

The pool is rebuilt only when `allowed_size` increases (positions 1 through `max_nodes`). Once it plateaus, the same locked arrays are reused for all remaining positions — no re-allocation, no re-locking.

### 4.10 Optimal Search: Exhaustive DFS with Precomputed Embedding Map

`--strategy optimal` runs a full backtracking search to find the longest valid sequence:

1. **Precompute `embeds_into[i]`** (parallel, O(N²)): for each candidate i, the list of candidates j where `embeds(tree_i, tree_j)`. Built once upfront; uses the fingerprint gate for fast rejection.
2. **Refcount rejection** (`Vec<u32>`): `rejected[j]` counts how many currently-accepted ancestors force j to be unavailable. Accept = increment; backtrack = decrement. No cloning needed.
3. **Upper-bound pruning**: if `current_len + live_count ≤ best_len`, prune — even using every remaining candidate cannot beat the known best.
4. **Largest-first ordering**: DFS finds strong solutions early, tightening the bound and pruning more branches.
5. **Incremental output**: `on_new_best` fires and writes SVGs each time a strictly longer sequence is found.

Practical limits for k=3:

| `--max-nodes` | N | Precompute | DFS |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | ~303 | instant | instant |
| 5 | ~1,788 | < 1 s | seconds |
| 6 | ~11,220 | ~30 s | minutes–hours |
| 7 | ~73,845 | minutes | impractical |

### 4.11 SVG Layout: Recursive Centering

The SVG renderer uses a simplified **Reingold-Tilford-style** layout:

1. Leaf nodes are assigned x-positions sequentially with spacing `H_SPACING * 2 = 100px`
2. Internal nodes are centered over their leftmost and rightmost children: `x = (x_first_child + x_last_child) / 2`
3. Depth determines y-position: `y = PADDING + 30 + depth * LEVEL_HEIGHT`
4. After layout, all x-coordinates are shifted so the leftmost node sits at `PADDING`

This runs in O(n) and produces non-overlapping layouts for trees that fit within the node budget.

Node colors by label:

| Label | Color | Hex |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 1 | Blue | `#4a90d9` |
| 2 | Orange | `#e8a838` |
| 3 | Red | `#e84c4c` |
| 4 | Green | `#6ab04c` |
| 5 | Purple | `#9b59b6` |
| 6 | Teal | `#1abc9c` |

---

## 7. Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain ≥ 1.70 (edition 2021)
- Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) if needed

### Debug build

```bash
cargo build
```

### Release build (recommended for large searches)

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The release binary is ~10-20x faster due to LLVM optimizations, which matters when searching over 500k+ candidate trees.

---

## 8. Running

### Quickstart

```bash
cargo run -- generate --count 10
```

This generates the first 10 trees in a TREE(3) sequence (labels {1,2,3}, max 8 nodes per tree) and writes SVGs to `./output/`.

### Run until exhausted

Omitting `--count` runs until no valid tree can be found for the given `--max-nodes` budget:

```bash
cargo run --release -- generate --max-nodes 9 --out ./output/full
```

The sequence terminates naturally when the candidate pool is exhausted. For `--max-nodes 9` this typically produces 20–30 trees before stopping.

### Validate TREE(2) = 3

```bash
cargo run -- generate --count 5 --labels 2 --max-nodes 5 --out ./output/tree2
```

Expected output — sequence ends at exactly 3 trees:

```
[001] Found tree (1 nodes): 1
[002] Found tree (2 nodes): 2(2)
[003] Found tree (3 nodes): 2(2(2))
Note: sequence ended at position 4 (no valid tree with <= 4 nodes found).
```

### Validate TREE(1) = 1

```bash
cargo run -- generate --count 5 --labels 1 --max-nodes 5 --out ./output/tree1
```

Sequence ends immediately after 1 tree — only one label means any single-node tree embeds into any other.

### Generate 20 trees with JSON export

```bash
cargo run -- generate --count 20 --max-nodes 8 --labels 3 --out ./output --export-json
```

### Large search (release mode)

```bash
cargo run --release -- generate --count 50 --labels 3 --max-nodes 10 --out ./output/large --export-json
```

> Warning: max-nodes 10 requires enumerating ~4.5 million candidate trees at startup. Expect several minutes even in release mode.

### Compare strategies

```bash
# Largest-first (default) — picks most complex trees early
cargo run -- generate --count 20 --strategy largest --out ./output/largest

# Smallest-first — picks simplest valid trees, tends to terminate sooner
cargo run -- generate --count 20 --strategy smallest --out ./output/smallest

# Random — different sequence each run
cargo run -- generate --count 20 --strategy random --out ./output/random

# Random with fixed seed — reproducible
cargo run -- generate --count 20 --strategy random --seed 42 --out ./output/random_seed
```

### Optimal exhaustive search

```bash
# Find the longest valid sequence with max 5 nodes (fast, seconds)
cargo run -- generate --strategy optimal --labels 3 --max-nodes 5 --out ./output/optimal

# Confirm TREE(2) = 3 by exhaustive search
cargo run -- generate --strategy optimal --labels 2 --max-nodes 5 --out ./output/optimal_tree2
```

---

## 9. CLI Reference

```
tree3 generate [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--count N` | *(none)* | Stop after N trees. **Omit to run until the sequence is exhausted.** |
| `--max-nodes N` | 8 | Hard cap on nodes per tree (independent of i-node rule) |
| `--labels N` | 3 | Label alphabet size; labels are `1..=N` |
| `--out PATH` | `./output` | Directory for SVG output files |
| `--export-json` | off | Also write `sequence.json` to the output directory |
| `--strategy` | `largest` | `largest`, `smallest`, `random`, or `optimal` |
| `--seed N` | *(none)* | RNG seed for `--strategy random`; omit for a time-based seed |

### The i-node rule vs `--max-nodes`

The i-th tree in a TREE(k) sequence is allowed at most **i nodes** (this is part of Friedman's definition). So:
- Tree 1: at most 1 node
- Tree 5: at most 5 nodes
- Tree 20: at most 20 nodes
- ...

`--max-nodes` provides an additional **hard cap** that overrides this — it prevents the tool from needing to enumerate trees with very large node counts when searching for high-index positions. The effective node budget for position `i` is `min(i, max_nodes)`.

## 10. Example Scripts

Pre-built `.cmd` scripts are in `./scripts/`:

| Script | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `run_basic.cmd` | 10 trees, TREE(3), largest strategy |
| `run_tree1.cmd` | TREE(1) — confirms sequence length 1 |
| `run_tree2.cmd` | TREE(2) — confirms sequence length 3 (greedy) |
| `run_smallest_strategy.cmd` | 20 trees, smallest-first selection |
| `run_random.cmd` | 20 trees, random strategy (fresh seed each run) |
| `run_random_seed.cmd` | 20 trees, random strategy, fixed seed 42 (reproducible) |
| `run_exhausted.cmd` | Run until pool exhausted (no `--count`), max-nodes 8 |
| `run_medium.cmd` | Greedy until exhausted, max-nodes 9, release build |
| `run_large.cmd` | 50 trees, max 10 nodes, release build |
| `run_optimal_tree2.cmd` | Optimal exhaustive search for TREE(2) — confirms length 3 |
| `run_optimal_small.cmd` | Optimal search, TREE(3), max-nodes 5 (fast) |
| `run_optimal_medium.cmd` | Optimal search, TREE(3), max-nodes 6, release build (slow) |

All scripts use `%~dp0..` so they work regardless of current working directory.

## 11. Output Format

### SVG files

Each accepted tree produces `output/tree_NNN.svg` **immediately when found** — files appear on disk during the run, not only at the end:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="..." height="...">
  <rect .../>                        <!-- background -->
  <text ...>T5 (5 nodes): ...</text> <!-- title -->
  <line .../> <line .../>            <!-- edges (drawn first) -->
  <circle .../> <text .../>          <!-- nodes with labels -->
</svg>
```

Nodes are colored by label (blue/orange/red for labels 1/2/3). Edges are gray. Labels are white text centered in each circle.

### overview.svg

`output/overview.svg` is a **live grid** showing every tree found so far. It is rewritten after each acceptance — open it in a browser tab and refresh to watch the sequence grow in real time. The grid uses 5 columns with a dark background; each cell shows the T-index, node count, canonical form, and a scaled rendering of the tree.

### sequence.json

Written when `--export-json` is passed:

```json
[
  {
    "index": 1,
    "nodes": 1,
    "canonical": "1",
    "tree": {
      "nodes": [{"label": 1, "children": [], "parent": null}],
      "root": 0
    }
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "nodes": 2,
    "canonical": "2(2)",
    "tree": { ... }
  }
]
```

The `tree` field contains the full arena-serialized structure, allowing reconstruction of the exact tree.

## 13. Known Limitations

### Greedy ≠ Optimal (for `largest`, `smallest`, `random`)

The three greedy strategies pick one candidate per position without backtracking. They do not guarantee the longest possible sequence. Use `--strategy optimal` for an exhaustive search — but note it is exponential time and only practical for small node budgets (see section 4.10).

### Practical Depth

| `--max-nodes` | Candidates | Approx. RAM | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 8 (default) | ~502k | ~100 MB | Fast; good for exploration |
| 9 | ~3.5 M | ~700 MB | ~20 s on 8 cores |
| 10 | ~24.5 M | ~5 GB | Needs `--release`; benefits from 32 GB RAM |
| 11 | ~171 M | ~33 GB | Borderline on 32 GB; not recommended |

The two flat arrays (fingerprints + rejection bitset) are locked in physical RAM via `mlock`/`VirtualLock` at startup. On Windows, run as Administrator or grant "Lock pages in memory" for regions above ~1 GB; the program continues without locking on failure.

## Mathematical Background

- **Kruskal's Tree Theorem** (1960): For any k, every infinite sequence of k-labeled rooted trees contains a pair Tᵢ, Tⱼ (i < j) where Tᵢ embeds into Tⱼ. This guarantees TREE(k) is finite.
- **Harvey Friedman** showed that TREE(3) is so large it is unprovable in ordinary mathematics (Peano Arithmetic and much stronger systems). Its finiteness is provable in stronger set theories.
- The growth rate of TREE(k) corresponds to the **small Veblen ordinal** in the fast-growing hierarchy — far beyond the Ackermann function, Graham's number, or any tower of towers.
